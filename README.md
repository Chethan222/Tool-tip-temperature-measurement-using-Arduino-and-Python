## Measurement of Tool Point Temperature during Machining: 
  The temperature developed in the tool can 
  be measured in different ways. We are using 
  K-type thermocouple to measure the temperature 
  because it is inexpensive and has good 
  reproducibility.
  
  
  In this experiment we are setting up a 
  temporary arrangement for measuring temperature 
  at the tool tip during turning operation in the center
  lathe. Temperature measuring device consists of an 
  assembly of K type thermocouple and Arduino. The
  tool being used in the experiment is a high carbon 
  steel tip with cast iron shank. A hole of diameter 
  4mm is drilled on the shank of the tool and a probe 
  of the thermocouple is inserted in the hole such that 
  it is close to the tool tip. The negative and positive 
  end of the thermocouple is connected to the 
  corresponding terminals of the temperature sensing 
  module. In this arrangement the temperature at the 
  tip of the tool will develop an emf in the 
  thermocouple which will be displayed in the 
  software. The tool is fixed on the tool post and the 
  work piece is fixed on the four-jaw chuck. The 
  reading is taken for different machining conditions 
  by varying the cutting parameters like cutting feed 
  and cutting speed.
